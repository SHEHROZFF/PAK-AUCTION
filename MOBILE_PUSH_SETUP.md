# Mobile Push Notifications Setup

## Issue: Expo Go Limitation

Expo Go no longer supports push notifications as of SDK 53. You need to create a development build.

## Quick Solutions:

### Option 1: Create Development Build (Recommended)

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli

# Login to Expo
eas login

# Configure EAS
eas build:configure

# Create development build for Android
eas build --platform android --profile development

# Create development build for iOS (requires Apple Developer account)
eas build --platform ios --profile development
```

### Option 2: Use Local Development Build

```bash
# For Android (requires Android Studio)
npx expo run:android

# For iOS (requires Xcode on macOS)
npx expo run:ios
```

### Option 3: Test Without Push Notifications (Quick Test)

For now, you can test the notification system without push notifications:

1. **Test Web Notifications**: Use the admin dashboard to send notifications and see them appear on the website
2. **Test Mobile API**: The mobile app can still fetch notifications from the API and display them in the notifications screen

## Current Status

✅ **Backend**: Push notification service is working
✅ **Mobile App**: Notification fetching and display is working
❌ **Mobile Push**: Requires development build (not Expo Go)

## Testing Steps for Now:

1. **Send notification from admin dashboard**
2. **Check website** - should appear in real-time
3. **Open mobile app** - pull to refresh notifications screen to see new notifications
4. **Create development build** - to test actual push notifications

## Development Build Setup (Detailed)

1. **Install EAS CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @expo/eas-cli
   eas login
   ```

2. **Configure project**:
   ```bash
   cd auction-mobile
   eas build:configure
   ```

3. **Build for Android**:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform android --profile development
   ```

4. **Install on device**:
   - Download the APK from the build URL
   - Install on your Android device
   - Test push notifications

The notification system is fully functional - just needs a development build for push notifications to work on mobile!
